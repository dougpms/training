### Rosseta (fix)
Using this fix in order to correct some Terraform provider issues with Mac processors
```
brew uninstall terraform
brew install tfenv
TFENV_ARCH=amd64 tfenv install 1.3.3
tfenv use 1.3.3
```

### Modules

Within the Terraform folder there are several modules that will be explained further in this README.
The concept behind it was build some child-modules that can be deployed alone or as part of root-module (i.e /vpc and /ec2).
