Description:

Acceptance criteria:
Stories:
Given any resource created by this repository
When a new day comes (midnight)
Then all resources will be destroyed

Technical notes:
Lambda running Python with Boto3 are a good approach for this. Also you can fetch the resource list in the Terraform state in the S3 bucket in order to make script more efficient
